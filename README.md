Music Genre Classification

This is a Machine Learning project made in Python, on classifying music genres on the basis of timbre, pitch, danceability, acousticness, energy, instrumentalness, liveness, speechiness and tempo of the input .wav file. The project trains ML models like Decision Tree, Random Forest and KNN. 

With the rise in music and it's free availability across online platforms warrants the need to classify them into genres for better classification. It also helps listeners to explore more music of their own taste. Music genres are important because they are one of the few and most effective tools we have at our disposal for understanding and discussing artists' creations. When used flexibly and descriptively, not as a means of rigid division, these classifications have the power to substantially improve our comprehension, recognition, and appreciation of the music we hear.
